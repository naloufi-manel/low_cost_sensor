For the device part, this sensor is designed for environmental activists to monitor the water quality using low cost sensor. It is based on arduino uno and 
can currently monitor 5 parameters: Temperature, pH, Electrical conductivity, Turbidity and Dissolved Oxygen. The data is stored on a micro SD card. All the modules are easy to change or add. Most of the sensors used are from DFRobot.
In addition to the 5 included sensors, you can add other environmental sensors, such as light, temperature, humidity sensors and a communication module to collect data from distance. 

## Step by step demos in the course walk you through the learning process.
