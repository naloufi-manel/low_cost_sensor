# Data recovery and storage 


## Create a replit account : ```https://replit.com/```

- Create a repl
- 
- Upload the 2 python files: ```Main.py``` and ```keep_alive.py```
- 
- From the webview copy the URL (This URL will be used to keep the code running 24/7 even after leaving the workspace) :
- 
```https://senddata.manel25.repl.co ```


## Create an account on uptimerobot : ```https://uptimerobot.com/```

-Add new monitor

-Copy the URL from the webview of replit

-Set the monitor interval (for the free version the minimum is 5 min) ==> every 5 minutes uptimerobot will load the URL which will keep the code running

 
## Run the code on Replit 

## Data pre-processing

- Every week you need to download the file to make sure you don't lose any data. Before data processing can begin, files must be converted from the ```.json``` format to ```.csv``` format using the following code ```convert_json_to_csv.ipynb```.
